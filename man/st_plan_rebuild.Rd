\usage{
st_plan_rebuild(
  targets,
  depth = Inf,
  include_targets = FALSE,
  mode = c("propagate", "strict")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{targets}{Character vector of artifact paths.}

\item{depth}{Integer depth >= 1, or Inf.}

\item{include_targets}{Logical; if TRUE and a target is stale, include it at level 0.}

\item{mode}{"propagate" (default) or "strict".}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns:
level, path, reason, latest_version_before
}
\description{
Returns the set of \emph{stale descendants} of \code{targets}.
Two modes:
\itemize{
\item \code{"propagate"} (default): treat each \code{target} as "will change",
then breadth-first schedule children whose parents intersect the set of nodes
marked "will change". Newly scheduled nodes are also marked "will change"
so their children are considered at the next level.
\item \code{"strict"}: only include nodes already stale against their parents'
\emph{current} latest versions (no propagation).
}
}
