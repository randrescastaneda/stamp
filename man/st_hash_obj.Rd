\title{Stable SipHash-1-3 of an R object}
\usage{
st_hash_obj(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Any R object (data.frame, data.table, list, vector, etc.)}
}
\value{
Lowercase hex string (16 hex characters) from siphash13().
}
\description{
Computes a stable hash of an R object by serializing it with
\code{base::serialize(version = 3)} and hashing the resulting bytes via
\code{secretbase::siphash13()}. The hash is stable across R sessions (given the
same R version and object structure) and suitable for change detection.
}
\section{Attribute Normalization}{

Before hashing, this function normalizes the order of object attributes to
ensure consistent hashes even when operations (like \code{collapse::rowbind()} +
\code{collapse::funique()}) leave attributes in different orders.

The normalization reorders attributes to a canonical form:
\enumerate{
\item Priority attributes: names, row.names, class, .internal.selfref
\item Other attributes: alphabetically sorted
}

This ensures that logically identical objects produce identical hashes
regardless of their attribute creation history.
}

\section{Why This Matters}{

Without normalization, two data.frames that are \code{identical()} can produce
different hashes if their internal attributes are in different orders. This
breaks change detection in stamp, causing false positives where objects are
incorrectly flagged as changed.
}

\section{Performance}{

\itemize{
\item For small to medium objects: negligible overhead
\item For large objects: creates a shallow copy (data is referenced, not duplicated)
\item The normalization cost is typically < 1\% of total hashing time
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Two ways to create the "same" data
dt_a <- data.table(x = 1:5) |> funique()
dt_b <- data.table(x = 1:5) |> rowbind(data.table(x = 1:5)) |> funique()

# They're identical in content
identical(dt_a, dt_b)  # TRUE

# And now they hash the same too!
st_hash_obj(dt_a) == st_hash_obj(dt_b)  # TRUE
}

}
