\title{Load a specific version of an artifact}
\usage{
st_load_version(path, version_id, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character path to the artifact (same value used with \code{st_save}/\code{st_load}).}

\item{version_id}{Character version identifier (as returned by \code{st_save} or present in the catalog).}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE (default), print informational messages.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments forwarded to the format's read function (e.g. \code{read} options).}
}
\value{
The object produced by the format-specific read handler (typically an R object loaded from disk).
}
\description{
Load a previously committed snapshot for an artifact identified by
\code{path} and \code{version_id}. The artifact file for the requested version is
read from the version snapshot directory using the format-specific
read handler registered in the package. This is useful for inspecting or
restoring historical versions of artifacts.
}
\details{
The function will abort if the requested version snapshot does not
exist or if there is no registered format handler for the artifact's
format.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# load a historical version of a dataset
old <- st_load_version("data/cleaned.rds", "20250101T000000Z-abcdef01")
