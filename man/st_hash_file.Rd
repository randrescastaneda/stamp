\alias{st_hash_file}
\title{SipHash-1-3 of a file (bytes on disk)}
\usage{
st_hash_file(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character path to a file}
}
\value{
Lowercase hex string (16 hex characters) from siphash13().
}
\description{
Computes a hash of a file's contents by reading the file as raw bytes and
hashing them via \code{secretbase::siphash13()}. This is faster than reading the
file into R first because \code{secretbase} can stream the file directly.
}
\section{Use Cases}{

\itemize{
\item Detecting if an artifact file has been modified on disk
\item Verifying file integrity across copies
\item Checking if a file needs to be re-saved
}
}

\section{Note}{

This hashes the file's raw bytes, not its R representation. If you save an
R object with \code{saveRDS()}, the file hash will change even if the object
content is the same (due to timestamps, compression variation, etc.). Use
\code{st_hash_obj()} for content-based hashing of R objects.
