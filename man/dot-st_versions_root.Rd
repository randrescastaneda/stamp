\description{
\strong{DEPRECATED}: This function returns the old centralized versions directory.
In the current architecture, versions are stored per-artifact in
\verb{<artifact_folder>/versions/} rather than in a central location.

For compatibility with old vignettes and examples, this still returns
\verb{<root>/<state_dir>/versions}, but this location is no longer used
for storing new versions.
